      Markup is way of the
      <em><strong>HTML</strong> Formatting</em> the elements
      on the web browser

      <strong>Molecule name:</strong>
      <em>Sulfur hexafluoride</em>
    </p>

      <strong>Molecular formula:</strong>
      C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>

    Note: This gas has a much higher density than air.
    Basically the opposite of helium. Crazy!

    lists as a whole must have the closing tag but li it's

    HTML elements review 2 Now you've learned about many
    more HTML elements! This page is a summary of all the
    elements you've seen so far. You can use this page as a
    reference if you forget how to use one of these elements
    in your code. Block elements Block elements are used for
    large sections of text, such as paragraphs, headlines,
    or lists; and also for some other features such as video
    players and tables. A block element creates a (usually
    invisible) box in the browser display. By default, this
    box takes up the full width of the display. The
    beginning of a block always starts on a new line in the
    display. Most block elements have a particular way they
    are displayed by default: paragraphs have margins around
    them; lists have bullet-points or numbered items;
    headlines are printed in large text. There is also a
    generic block element, div, which has no special
    defaults. p — Paragraph. Text in a paragraph is
    separated visually from other paragraphs by a small
    margin. ul and ol — Unordered and ordered lists. By
    default, ul lists are displayed with bullet points, and
    ol lists with numbered items. li — List items inside a
    ul or ol list. The li element has to be nested inside a
    ul or ol list; it can't occur on its own. Section
    headers, from h1 (largest) to h6 (smallest). Used for
    headlines, section titles, and the like. div — A logical
    division of a page or document. Other block elements
    such as paragraphs, lists, and headers can be nested
    inside a div. You will see the div element much more in
    the next lesson. Because they don't have any default
    display settings, divs are heavily used with custom
    styling with CSS. Inline elements Inline elements do not
    create a full-width box on the display. They modify the
    display of text, or insert other things into the text —
    such as line breaks, images, or hyperlinks. em and
    strong — Emphasis. By default, text inside an em is
    displayed as italic, and text in strong is displayed as
    boldface. br — Line break. (empty) A line break does not
    create a new paragraph; it only marks the end of a line.
    sub and sup — Subscript and superscript. Useful for math
    and chemistry: I have x3+2x2 molecules of H2O. mark —
    Highlighting. Not very often used, but it's kind of
    cool. Some of the inline elements you've seen require
    attributes, extra information besides the name of the
    element itself. Attributes are written inside the
    opening tag of the element. img — Images. Needs a src
    attribute with a URL, and an alt attribute with
    descriptive text. a — Hyperlinks. Needs an href
    attribute with a URL. Images The syntax for the img tag
    is like this:

    <img
      src="Image URL here"
      alt="A description of the image"
    />
    The URL of an image may be an absolute URL, such as
    http://placebear.com/800/600, or it may be a relative
    URL such as images/wolves.jpg. The alt text is used if
    the image can't be loaded, or if the user can't see
    images — such as if the user is using a screen reader.
    Links Hyperlinks allow the user to navigate from one
    page to another. They are created using the a element.
    The destination of the link is written in an attribute
    called href; the link text appears as the contents of
    the a element. Here's an example:

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">
      Wikipedia's "Hypertext" article
    </a>
