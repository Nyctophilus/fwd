			File System Flags
	
	File System Flags are used for identifying read/write operations available when opening a file.

	r - allows for the reading of a file
	r+ - allows for the reading and writing of a file, will overwrite content in the file
	w+ - allows for the reading and writing of a file, will create a file if it does not yet exist
	a - allows for reading and writing of a file and will append new content to the end of the file, not overwriting current content
	a+ - allows for reading and writing of a file, will create a file if it does not yet exist, and will append new content to the end of the file, not overwriting current content
