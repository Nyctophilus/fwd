	- the capturing phase

	- the bubbling phase

	capturing phase: when event fired! capturing begins ...> start decending from 
	window > document > html > body >.. so on till finds the target element

	at target phase: Most event handlers run here

	bubbling phase: the event will "bubble" upward to the parent, and keep bubbling until something handles it or it hits the document.

/*
		-HL Event Delegation

		.addEventListener to the parent to not over number of listeners & its handlers
		u can event.target to gain direct access to each element inside the parent element!

		-HL DOMContentLoaded Event

		 -HL .onload() 
		  waits until all of the images, stylesheets, etc. have been loaded (everything referenced by the HTML.)
